### modified masterwork dwarf fortress

This is the amostubal produced variant of masterwork dwarf fortress, began on March 16, 2017. 

Short history: 
This variant was based off of the v1.23 of masterwork by meph last updated on December 09,2016. 
Since then we have updated the Df game engine to 43.05 x64.  Additionally, we've been updating all the extras from DFHack to the graphic files...  Many fixes have been made and the code now is very stable compared to when we started.

Additionally we have upgraded the launcher to fix many of the bugs that were in its code, and added many new features to improve the game experience!
